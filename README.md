SlugBall Showdown

SlugBall Showdown is an exciting, physics-based soccer game inspired by Super Slime Soccer. Created during the Code For All Programming Bootcamp as a group project for Game Week, SlugBall Showdown brings intense two-player action to your screen. Built in Java and utilizing the Simple Graphics Library with Keyboard Events, this game showcases realistic physics and dynamic gameplay.
Key Features and Gameplay Mechanics

    Realistic Physics: Experience lifelike movement, bouncing, and physical forces that make the game challenging and fun.
    Two-Player Mode: Enjoy competitive play with friends using keyboard controls.
        Player 1 Controls: A (left), D (right), W (jump)
        Player 2 Controls: Left Arrow (left), Right Arrow (right), Up Arrow (jump)
    Customizable Options: Change slime skins, background images, and adjust game settings like sound volume and match goals.
    Simple Yet Engaging: Jump, move left and right, and score goals to win the game. No complex powers or single-player AI.

How It Differs from Super Slime Soccer

While SlugBall Showdown shares many similarities with Super Slime Soccer, it has its unique aspects:

    Two-Player Focus: Only a two-player mode is available due to the time constraints of the bootcamp project.
    Unified Slime Abilities: All slimes share the same basic movement and jumping abilities. Different powers for each slime type are planned for future updates.
    Customizable Settings: Includes a menu for starting the game and configuring options like skins, backgrounds, sound volume, and match goals.
