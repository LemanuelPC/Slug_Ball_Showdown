# SlugBall Showdown

SlugBall Showdown is an exciting, physics-based football game inspired by Super Slime Soccer. Created during the Code For All Programming Bootcamp as a group project for Game Week, SlugBall Showdown brings intense two-player action to your screen. Built in Java and utilizing the Simple Graphics Library with Keyboard Events, this game showcases realistic physics and dynamic gameplay.

## Key Features and Gameplay Mechanics

- **Realistic Physics:** Experience lifelike movement, bouncing, and physical forces that make the game challenging and fun.
- **Two-Player Mode:** Enjoy competitive play with friends using keyboard controls.
- **Customizable Options:** Change slime skins, background images, and adjust game settings like sound volume and match goals.
- **Simple Yet Engaging:** Jump, move left and right, and score goals to win the game. No complex powers or single-player AI.

## How It Differs from Super Slime Soccer

While SlugBall Showdown shares many similarities with Super Slime Soccer, it has its unique aspects:
- **Two-Player Focus:** Only a two-player mode is available due to the time constraints of the bootcamp project.
- **Unified Slime Abilities:** All slimes share the same basic movement and jumping abilities. Different powers for each slime type are planned for future updates.
- **Customizable Settings:** Includes a menu for starting the game and configuring options like skins, backgrounds, sound volume, and match goals.
